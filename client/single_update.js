// * Tell Express to send this file when it receives a GET request to `'/chirps/*/update'`
//     * This page will contain an input box for the message of the chirp
//     * It will also display the chirp author's name, but it will not be in an editable format
//     * When the page loads, look at the url and figure out which chirp to GET from the API
//     * Populate the message input box with the text of the chirp returned from the server
//     * After a user changes the message, clicking the Update button will cause an API call to update the chirp
//         * When that is successful, navigate back to the single chirp page for this chirp
